## Synopsis

This is an API for generating a graph data structure, and then performing common search algorithms on that data structure. Results are displayed to a web browser.

Example of this code running on AWS can be found here:

## Motivation

This is mainly to strengthen my portfolio by demonstrating some ES6 Javascript running on a backend server.

This is an individual project built using node.js for the back-end. It also features a graph data-structure constructed from scratch, and graph algorithms for depth-first search and breadth-first-search. The data structure and algorithms are written in Javascript ES6.

## Installation
Initialize:
```
npm update
```

Build the server for development:
```
npm start
```

Point browser to http://localhost:8000
